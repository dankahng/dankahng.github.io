Nice to meet you, my name is Daniel Kahng and I am a graduate student and researcher in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada. Prior to working in linguistics, I attained degrees in Finance, Graphic Design, and a professional certification in User Experience (UX) design. This unique background and perspective motivates and guides my research process today, and I believe will truly be an asset to future academic and non-academic career opportunities. Please reach out if you'd like to connect!
